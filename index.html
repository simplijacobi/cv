                    <p><strong>Welcome</strong></p>
                        <p>Hi, I'm Jacobi and I have called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio">San Antonio</a>, TX home my whole life.</p>
                        <p>For over a decade I have served the members of my community in varying roles, working with non-profits, educational institutions, and local technical support.</p>
                        <p>I see my role as a support character in your life story. For most people buying or selling a home is a significant life event and represents a notable mile marker in your life.</p>
                        <p>My responsibility to you is to give you straight forward advise on how to best navigate the process. What people who have worked with me have said they most appreciate is my straightforward and efficient approach to problem solving.</p>
